Task 3
b) The data fits almost well. It does follows the trend as per our expectations for lower values. However with the increasing values of "log of R_gal," the linear becomes less and less fitted. 

e) From my point of view, I have used the appropriate number of bins for constructing the plot. Lesser bins can cause a loss of details and also overlapping whereas having a large number of bins can cause increased noise and are intensive to compute. 

f) The 2D Histogram has been made for the residuals. It also follows a similar trend to the rest of the plots thereby adding proof to our existing theory.
